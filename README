qlibxmlnodemodel - A QAbstractXmlNodeModel for using with libxml2 library
=========================================================================

qlibxmlnodemodel is a QAbstractXmlNodeModel implementation for libxml2 library.
It uses libxml2 for HTML parsing and offers the document as a custom XML node
model that can be used with Qt's XmlPatterns module. This allows you to use
XPath, XQuery, XSLT and other fun stuff by standard QT means on HTML documents
that aren't valid XML.

Usage is quite simple - please take a look at the examples and / or read
the usage notes at http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qabstractxmlnodemodel.html#usage
